# frisbee

The Frisbee is the perfect tool to make new inventions out of e-waste, old toys and everyday objects.

The Frisbee is a microcontroller that can be plugged into any computer via USB and is recognized as a keyboard. Thus, similar to the Makey Makey ( https://makeymakey.com/ ), all conductive objects can be used to close circuits and trigger keystrokes. So a fork stuck in an apple becomes a space bar, or a high-five with your best friend becomes an arrow key.
If you still haven't had enough, you can turn the frisbee upside down to the dark side and dive deeper into the rabbit hole of makers and coders.
